1) I don't like sqlmapper naming. Also under the folder we have loading json files
2) Repository naming is not good. Also please review other namings as they sometimes are confusing
3) Loading objects 1 by 1 is not optimal solution 
4) I don't see any profit of using interfaces.py
5) I like dotenv usage
6) main.py can be executed by dividing code to separate functions. Having helper functions in main is not good. Also there is no need to save to json queries results
